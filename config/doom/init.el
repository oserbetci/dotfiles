;; This file controls what Doom modules are enabled and what order they load
;; in. Remember to run 'doom sync' after modifying it!

;; NOTE Press 'SPC h d h' (or 'C-h d h' for non-vim users) to access Doom's
;;      documentation. There you'll find a "Module Index" link where you'll find
;;      a comprehensive list of Doom's modules and what flags they support.

;; NOTE Move your cursor over a module's name (or its flags) and press 'K' (or
;;      'C-c c k' for non-vim users) to view its documentation. This works on
;;      flags as well (those symbols that start with a plus).
;;
;;      Alternatively, press 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') on a module to browse its
;;      directory (for easy access to its source code).

This uses `defvaralias' and `make-obsolete-variable' (which see).
See the Info node `(elisp)Variable Aliases' for more details.

If CURRENT-NAME is a defcustom or a defvar (more generally, any variable
where OBSOLETE-NAME may be set, e.g. in an init file, before the
alias is defined), then the define-obsolete-variable-alias
statement should be evaluated before the defcustom, if user
customizations are to be respected.  The simplest way to achieve
this is to place the alias statement before the defcustom (this
is not necessary for aliases that are autoloaded, or in files
dumped with Emacs).  This is so that any user customizations are
applied before the defcustom tries to initialize the
variable (this is due to the way `defvaralias' works).

WHEN should be a string indicating when the variable was first
made obsolete, for example a date or a release number.

For the benefit of Customize, if OBSOLETE-NAME has
any of the following properties, they are copied to
CURRENT-NAME, if it does not already have them:
`saved-value', `saved-variable-comment'."
